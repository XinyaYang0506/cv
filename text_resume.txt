  Role:   research assistant 
  Time:   06/2018 - 05/2020
    I have contributed to three projects: 
    1. Checkboard: Use virtual page aliasing to mitigate false sharing, a cache performance issue. 
    - Wrote a customized memory allocator.
    - Utilized hardware performance stats as heuristics.
    2. No Use after Free: A customized memory allocator to prevent all use-after-free and double-free errors in C/C++, which are currently the top root causes of CVE
    - Utilized virtual page aliasing and MMU to invalidate freed objects.
    - Covered corner cases including large objects, interior pointers, parallel programs.
    - Very low time overhead in the evaluation process (7/10 benchmarks have 1% overhead).
