RESEARCH
Company: Systems and Languages Research Lab @ Grinnell College
Role:   research assistant 
Time:   June 2018 - May 2020
I have contributed to three projects: 
1. Checkboard: Use virtual page aliasing to mitigate false sharing, a cache performance issue. 
- Wrote a customized memory allocator.
- Utilized hardware performance stats as heuristics.
2. No Use after Free: A customized memory allocator to prevent all use-after-free and double-free errors in C/C++, which are currently the top root causes of CVE
- Utilized virtual page aliasing and MMU to invalidate freed objects.
- Covered corner cases including large objects, interior pointers, parallel programs.
- Very low time overhead in the evaluation process (7/10 benchmarks have 1% overhead).
3. AnaLysis of EXecution: A software profiler to analyze physical resource usage.
- Spearheaded the development of the data visualization part using D3.js.
- Streamlined C++ code collecting performance data through Linux API.
- Designed and standardized the data format for the data analysis in Protocol Buffers.
Keywords: C/C++, profiler, memory safety, optimization, cache, system programming, operating system.
