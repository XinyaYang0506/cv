RESEARCH
 Systems and Languages Research Lab @ Grinnell College
  research assistant 
  June 6.1.2018 - Present

  Project 1: ALEX - Developing a software profiler to improve program performance (increasing physical resource usage) by data analysis

   • Spearheaded the development of data visualization part using d3.js 
   • Debugged and streamlined C++ code collecting performance data through Linux API

   • Designed and standardized the data format for the data analysis in Protocol Buffers 

   • Followed an Agile flow and acquired good version control

  New project 2: utilizing virtual page aliasing to optimize false sharing




 Washington University in St. Louis CSE Department

  REU participant, student researcher

  Summer 5.27 - 8.02 2019 

  Understanding the use of blockchain in IoT (Raspberry Pi) from a system perspective 

   • Conducted a literature review on the use of blockchain in IoT 

   • Deployed several commercial blockchains to Raspberry Pis and set up private chains 

   • Implemented blockchain prototypes (PoW PoS) w/ Go as a future benchmark usage 

   • Developed a GUI for the inspection of different consensuses using PyQT5


CLASS PROJECT (all March - May 2019) 
 computer vision class project: queue size determination (link: https://github.com/YourFin/QueueTime)
  A pipeline to calculate the size of a queue in the videos using deep learning techniques and
 heuristics
   • Implemented and trained the YOLO model w/ Coco dataset using Keras to detect and localize human in video frames
   • Designed a lightweight yet effective algorithm for ”in queue or not” determination
   • Experimented the above two parts w/ different hyper-parameter systematically for analysis



 Advanced operating system class project: no use after free (link: https://github.com/gaffordb/nuaf)
  A customized memory allocator using Heaplayer to prevent all use-after-free and double-free errors in C/C++, which are currently the top root causes of CVE
   • Utilized virtual page aliasing and MMU to invalidate freed objects
   • Covered corner cases including large objects, interior pointers, parallel programs
   • Achieved very low time overhead in the evaluation process (7/10 benchmarks have <1% overhead)



 Environmental chemistry class project: Lead Concentration in Drinking Water • | environmental chemistry (link: https://github.com/XinyaYang0506/Pb-in-drinking-water-grinnell/blob/master/EVN240_final_poster.pdf)
  Part of the largest investigation into drinking water lead levels in the local area
   • Wrote scientific instructions of sampling and collected 44 water samples in total
   • Ran through ICP-MS to measure the lead and iron concentration
   • Drew conclusions based on data visualization and stats method, such as ANOVA
  NEW project: developing a web-based data visualization for water management practice research


TEACHING & EXTRACURRICULAR
 Intro CS Classes & Liberal Arts in Prison
 teaching assistant, mentor, tutor & grader
 Fall 2017 - Present
  • Grade homework and labs, hold review sessions once per week, and write worksheets
  • Create and maintain the webpage of extra resources for students https://xinyayang0506.github.io/CSC-151/
  • Emphasize the use of diagram and high-level planning and offer learning strategies
  • Lead 1:1 math courses for students in prison w/o concrete math foundation
  • Meet with the professor and other TAs once per week to improve the class design for better experience of students.


 Grinnell AppDev iOS Team
 developer & group coordinator
 Fall 2018 - Present
